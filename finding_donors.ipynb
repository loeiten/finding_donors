    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. Itâ€™s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."
